Dear Santa,

My name is Fritz. I'm fourteen, and I live in Germany. My hobbies are going to discos and listening to music on the radio. In the summer I like to swim in the lake. I do not have any brothers or sisters. I take the bus to school. I am in year 9 at my school. My birthday is on Friday of this year. I hope I will receive a new guitar.
When I am grow up I would like to be a scientist, especially a geophysicist.

Yours,
Fritz Cola

Dear Fritz,

Ho! Ho! Ho! Greetings from the North Pole!

I'm so delighted to receive your letter. It sounds like you have a wonderful life in Germany, filled with music and swimming in the lake during those warm summer days. Being an only child must be quite an adventure, and it's impressive that you're already navigating your way to school by bus. Keep up the good work in year 9!

Ah, a birthday on a Friday â€“ what a perfect start to the weekend! I'll make a note about your wish for a new guitar. Music is a magical gift that brings joy to so many, and it's wonderful to hear you're cultivating this passion.

Your ambition to become a geophysicist is truly inspiring, Fritz. The world always needs bright and curious minds like yours, eager to explore and understand the mysteries of our planet. Remember, every great scientist started out as a curious youngster, just like you. Keep dreaming big and studying hard!

Until the magical night when my sleigh takes flight, I'll be keeping an eye on your progress and cheering you on from the frosty skies. Remember, the spirit of Christmas is not just about receiving gifts, but also about the joy of learning, exploring, and growing.

Wishing you a very Happy Birthday and a wonderful year ahead filled with music, learning, and joy.

With jolly wishes,

Santa Claus
